    Hi Liam,

    Hi Liam, thanks for your email! I really appreciate your invitation.
    I think I am most interested in that walking tour of Hadrian's wall. I'm a
big fan of the Roman history and culture so this is an easy choice for me.
    Before I plan the trip to the city I would like to know how long the
trip will be.
    To be honest I am a bit worried about the price so it would be nice if you
could tell me the price of the this tour and when it will start so I can start
preplanning my journey to the city.
    Really looking forward to hearing from you soon! Best regards, Bence.
