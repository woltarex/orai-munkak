    Hello Michael,
    Thank you for your last email, I am fascinated by your cats behaviour.
I wanted to share with you an incident that happened to me recently, which was
quite unusual and unexpected.
    Last Saturday, I was on my way back home from the supermarket, and as I was
crossing the street, a sudden gust of wind blew my grocery bag away. I was left
standing there in shock, watching my groceries fly away in different
directions. While I was trying to gather them, I noticed a man walking towards
me with a huge smile on his face. To my surprise, he started picking up my
groceries and handing them over to me one by one. We both laughed about the
situation, and he even helped me carry my groceries back to my flat.
    It may seem like a small incident, but it was unusual for me because it
restored my faith in humanity. In a time where people are always in a rush and
often indifferent towards others, this act of kindness from a stranger was
truly heartwarming.
    I hope you are doing well, and we can catch up soon.
    Best regards, John.
