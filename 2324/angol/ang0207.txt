Dear Madam/Sir,
I am writing to you because I have reed your advertisement about your workshop
in New York City, and I would like to join this workshop.
I am hoping I can improve my writing skills because I will apply to university
next year, so it would be nice to gather some skills to write better.
I have studied English in primary and secondary school, and I have an expert
level language exam, although I am not a native, so I sometimes struggle with
proper wording.
I would like to take part in your 4-week summer class, starting in July. Could
you please inform me about how much the course costs, so we can finalize my join.
I am looking forward to your reply!
Yours faithfully,
Bence Bársony



Greg,

I've read post and it made wander what I had done in the same situation.

I can relate to your problem because I have been in the same situation several
times. I was the kid in class who was bullied quite heavily almost every day.
There was a kid in my class who humiliated me at least 5 times with the same
lie as your classmate, Frank.

Speaking of humiliation, In my mind there is a big difference between a joke and
humiliation. When someone humiliate you, they damage your reputation, and I
think this is the worst part of the story, because it is so hard to repair it.
I'm wondering if you think abput this the same way as I do.

I think it would have been sensible to punch that guy in the face, although I
don't really recommend doing it now. I suppose your friend should talked to him
as well, a good friend is standing by your side in these kind of situations. 
I'm sorry you cannot resolve this when you have talked to Frank.

But in my opinion you should talk with him about this as soon as possible in a
calm, straight-forward manner. Maybe it would be nice to take your friend with
you.

I hope you can resolve this issue as soon as you can.
Best regards,
Bence Bársony
